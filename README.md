# Java Coding Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to give you an opportunity to show us what you know and how you would work in a real life project.

## General aspects
We expect you to fork this github repository that contains the instructions, project structure and basic assets.<br>
Please always commit and push over your fork and when you are done create a pull request to this repository to deliver the results.<br>
In order to be practical, we ask you to make one commit per challenge part and use the comment to identify it.  Ie: commit description `"A"` should have all the changes to answer the challenge part `A`.

- You will find the application basic structure and the code in the `cars` folder. You should use the `ANSWERS.md` file if you want to write a description or explanation of your code/solution.
- Be sure to always include your code and also the written answers/explanations in the `ANSWERS.md` file within the same commit if they belongs to the same challenge part. 
- To simplify things we added some necessary assets and configuration needed in `src/main/resources` folder.

> After cloning the repository, you should be ready to start up the cars application at port `8080` with the command `mvn springboot:run`

### The application technology
Here is the list of the technologies we are providing in the application structure: 
 - Java 8
 - Spring boot 2.1.4
 - Maven 3.3.9 or above
 - Tomcat server 9 (embedded)
 - H2 embedded database
 - Spring Data JPA

> Be free to add any necessary dependency you need to achieve the challenge but please, keep the above technologies and versions in the project as they already are.


## Challenge introduction
Our customer is a big car vendor in California with many local branches all over the US.<br> 
He asked for a service that enables the current seller's application in the different local branches to consume the car specifications.<br>
Nowadays the car specifications comes from the different car factories in different formats, the idea is to unify the data and expose it with a standar interface like a RESTful webservice. 

### A - The entities
You can find an example of Ford's car file specification named `ford-example.xml` within the main resources of the car application. 

Create a UML class model diagram to explain how you will represent the information in that file. Remember to create a normalized data structure, entities and relationships.

> Please provide the diagram as an image and include it in this answer commit.<br>
You can also use the `ANSWERS.md` file to explain in more detail if you want.

### B - Ingest the data
Our customer wants to start ingesting the Ford's car specifications that comes in XML format. 

You will find a scheduled task within the `FordIngesterTask` class that is configured to execute every minute. 
Use it in order to process the `ford-example.xml` file from the filesystem and insert all the data in the provided database as you designed at the part `A`.

> Feel free to modify the scheduled configuration in order to run the task more or less frequent as needed.

> We recommend to implement all the necessary using JPA entities and Spring repositories in order to persist the data.<br>
You will find a `com.mooveit.cars.repositories` and a `com.mooveit.cars.domain` java packages.
The cars application is already configured to find entities and repositories inside those packages.  

### C - Expose data with a RESTful API
Create the following RESTful API endpoints to:
 - Get a car specification by id
 - Get all the car specifications by brand
 
> All the endpoints must expose the results in JSON format.

### D - Adding images
Explain ***(no code needed)*** how you would do to add provided image files to the part `B` process.<br>
Take into account that they want to include them as part of the responses of the endpoints in part `C`.

### E - Improvements
Is there anything that you consider that can be improved in your solution? **Please explain**

## Deliverables
The client is going to code review the changes, so you must create a pull request.

## FAQ
- Should I deliver clean code and apply design patterns and good practices?
  - Definitely yes! We will evaluate those aspects.
- Do I need to add tests?
  - Tests are always important! In the case of this challenge they are not mandatory, but always test what you consider important.
- Do I need to use some specific libraries?
  - No, build the application with the tools you prefer, there are no limits. Just keep the ones that are already provided.
